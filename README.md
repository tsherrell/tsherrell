# ðŸ‘‹ Hello!

This is my temporary portfolio.

### Work examples

#### AI-powered business document & workflow automation

In this project, I led the UX and product design for an AI-driven system that streamlines business asset creation and workflow automation. The first proof of concept focused on employee handbook generation, where I designed an intuitive process that allows users to create documentation in minutes instead of months.

I collaborated with engineers to integrate AI capabilities trained on HR policies, industry regulations, and company-specific guidelines. Beyond static document creation, I designed a workflow where AI identifies actionable procedures and converts them into interactive, no-code workflows for seamless implementation. This approach improves efficiency, compliance, and accuracy, transforming how businesses manage essential documentation and processes.

#### Adaptive widget system for customisable dashboards

I designed a dynamic widget system for a homepage dashboard that gives users control over the complexity and depth of displayed information. My approach allows widgets to expand or collapse vertically based on user preferences, ensuring both high-level overviews and in-depth insights within the same interface. To enhance usability, I structured the layout to adapt responsively across different screen sizes while maintaining content visibility.

#### Unified paywall design for diverse subscription models

I led the UX design initiative to develop a flexible paywall system capable of supporting distinct subscription strategies for both the Chicago Tribune and the LA Times. By creating customisable options within a single structure, we enabled each publication to tailor their digital subscription offerings to their unique audiences. This approach streamlined the user experience and facilitated efficient management of subscription models across multiple news outlets.

#### Comprehensive use case auditing for payment integration

As UX Architect, I conducted an in-depth use case audit to facilitate the integration of a third-party payment processor. Recognising the diverse needs of stakeholders â€“ including engineers, managers, UX designers, legal teams, and leadership â€“ I developed multiple visualisation artefacts. These detailed screen flows mapped interactions across various financial systems, illustrating the function of each interface element for different operations and user roles. This approach ensured clear communication of complex processes, enabling informed decision-making and seamless integration planning.
